				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Journalist, editor, Storyteller</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;">I am a journalism major at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I use my journalistic and creative skills to create multimedia projects. I have a lot of experience in video work, but you will see that I can turn out great projects in any medium. I am also very familiar with graphic design and I am not afraid to let my creativity shine in my work!  Recently I have started to produce posed photography work such as portraits, group photos, or landscapes. I’m inspired by my environment and the things that surround me and I have a passion for telling stories.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;">Using my passion for this work, I deliver news by putting out quality projects across all platforms. I hope to continue to become a better journalist everyday and continue to be the best storyteller I can be.</p>

		<div class="why">
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why I Went Into Journalism</h2>
			<p style="text-align: center;">A passion for storytelling has always been a big part of my life. Although the path I wanted to take for my life has changed, I always knew I wanted to tell stories.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">When I was in middle school, I had decided that I wanted to be an author. My love for reading had driven me to want to create fantastic stories myself. When I entered high school, however, I realized that just being an author wouldn't sustain my living until I published and good book. This lead to me decide I would learn journalism skills in order to do work on the side while I wrote. Although the logic doesn't completely make sense, I am very glad I came to this conclusion back then.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">With this new plan, I joined the mass media class in my high school. I fell in love with journalism and I realized that telling the true stories of life was more appealing to me than building a fictional story. I dove headfirst into learning anything I could, and tried to gain as much experience as possible.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">My journey is still ongoing and as I work my way through college I am grateful that I found a field that I both enjoy and have talent in.</p>
